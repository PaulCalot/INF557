Towards the Transport Layer
	Goals of transport layer:
		present application data to receiving application while providing the desired end-to-end sementics
Different application might need different ent-to-end semantics thus different transport protocol...
2 cases:
	FIle Trnasport
		Order
		Reliability
			no packet are lost
		Integrity
			no packet is corrupted
		Idempotency
			remove duplicate messages
		Error Signals
			if a transmission is not succeed, both, sender and receiver must be aware of it
	VoIP
		Order and reliability are not important
		Integrity
		Idempotency
		Error Signals
		Delays
		"Waiting for retransmission or packet reordering is worse than a lost transmission"
Transport Layer Header
	Checksum
	source port
	source ip address (layer violation: pseudo-violation)
	destination port
	destination ip address (layer violation: pseudo-violation)

States
	A transport protocol connextion can be into 3 states:	
		Connection Setup
			- Find peer
			- Negotiate parameters
			- Set-up data structures (buffer, sockets, ...)
			bref the housekeeping before the data transfer
		Data transfer
			send/receive data
		Connection Tear-Down
			- Stop signalling
			- Free resources
	Not every Transport protocol have the tree states
		TCP pass by the three states but UDP for example has only the second state...
		since UDP dosn't set up a connexion
